# FX Trading Basics

Foreign exchange is a business of exchanging one currency for another. This exchange can take two basic forms: an **outright** or a **swap**. 
When two parties simply exchange one currency for another the transaction is an **outright**. 
For example, if one party gives the other dollars for Euros, they have completed an _**outright**_ transaction. 
If this exchange takes place for immediate delivery, it is called a _**spot**_ transaction; if it takes place for forward delivery, it is called a _**forward**_.

Two parties can also agree to exchange and re-exchange one currency for another. For example, one party gives the other dollars for Euros for immediate delivery 
and simultaneously agrees to re-exchange Euros for dollars at a specified rate at some time in the future.
These transactions are called _**swaps**_.

### WHAT IS AN OUTRIGHT?

An outright currency transaction involves two parties exchanging one currency for another.
The two parties must agree on the two currencies, the amount of one currency, the settlement date, and the exchange rate.
The amount of the second currency will be derived from a calculation involving the amount of the first currency and the exchange rate.

- __Outright rate of exchange/ spot:__ The amount of one unit of currency expressed in terms of the other.
- __Outright Transaction:__  The exchange of one currency for the other at the outright rate of exchange.

### VALUE DATES

The value date is the day the two parties actually exchange the two currencies. 
It is impractical, in most circumstances, for the value date and the trade date to be the same.
The forward value date is usually required to allow both parties time to arrange for payments which often occur in different time zones.

By market convention, foreign exchange trades settle two mutual business days (T + 2) after that trade date unless otherwise specified.
This is commonly referred to as value for spot. The spot exchange rate is the benchmark price the market uses to express the underlying value of the currency.
Rates for dates other than the spot are always calculated relative to the spot rate. 

Listed below are the various value dates available in the market-they are all determined relative to the deal date.
__Assume the deal date is Monday, December 12.__

| **Settlement**        | **Settlement/Value Date** | **Definition**                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cash                  | December 12               | Deal Date                                                            |
| Value "Tomorrow Next" | December 13               | One Mutual Business Day after Deal Date#                             |
| Spot                  | December 14               | Two Mutual Business Day after Deal Date++                            |
| Forward Outright      | December 15 or later      | Threw Business Days or More After Deal Date; Always Longer than Spot |
