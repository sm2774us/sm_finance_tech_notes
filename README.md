  - 1. What does it mean to trade an index ?

    Trading an index refers to buying and selling a financial product that is linked to an index of stocks or other [assets](https://capital.com/asset-definition).
    Index trading is a popular way for new traders to gain broad exposure to financial markets without owning company [stocks](https://capital.com/trade-stocks), 
    [bonds](https://capital.com/bond-definition), [commodities](https://capital.com/trade-commodities) or [currencies](https://capital.com/trade-forex) directly.

  - 2. How to trade indices ?

    You can trade an index using [futures](https://capital.com/futures-contract-explained) or [options contracts](https://capital.com/option-contract-basics), 
    exchange-traded fund ([ETF](https://capital.com/trade-etfs)) or contract for difference ([CFDs](https://capital.com/what-is-cfd-trading)). Once you have 
    decided which underlying index you want to trade, you should adopt a well-defined trading strategy and open a position. 
    Using [technical](https://capital.com/technical-analysis-definition) and [fundamental analysis](https://capital.com/fundamental-analysis-definition) tools will 
    help you identify entry and exit points for your position.

  - 3. What is the best time trade indices ?

    The best time to trade an index will depend on the assets it covers, where it is based and the trading hours for the 
    [stock exchange](https://capital.com/stock-exchanges) if it’s a stock index. It will also depend on market drivers such as company announcements, economic news 
    and political events, which can all trigger market [volatility](https://capital.com/volatility-definition).

  - 4. How does index trading compare to stock trading ?

    Whether index trading or stock trading is more suitable for you would depend on your personal circumstances. Trading indices can reduce risk as they provide 
    exposure to a basket of company stocks, commodity futures or bonds, rather than a single asset, increasing 
    [diversification](https://capital.com/diversification-definition). This can limit the damage if a share price plunges when a company goes bankrupt, 
    for example. However, by spreading exposure across a large number of companies, traders can miss out on the full extent of the returns if a high-growth stock 
    takes off. Remember, that only you can decide what is the best asset for you, and never trade with money that you cannot afford to lose.
